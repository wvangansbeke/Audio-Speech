# Audio-Speech

# Audio
## Part1: 
1) Uses a simulation environment to model room acoustics and multi-source scenarios.
2) Takes a first step towards direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation based on microphone
signal correlation analysis.

## Part2: 
1) Implements the MUSIC algorithm
2) Investigates MUSIC-based DOA estimation

## Part3: 
1) Implements a DOA-informed delay-and-sum beamformer
2) Implements a DOA-informed generalized sidelobe canceler

## Part4: 
1) Reproduces a virtual sound source by means of binaural synthesis
2) Binaural synthesis with cross-talk cancellation

# Speech
Design a speech recognizer.
